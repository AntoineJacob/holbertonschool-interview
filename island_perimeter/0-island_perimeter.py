def island_perimeter(grid):
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid.

    Args:
        grid (list of list of int): A rectangular grid where:
            - 0 represents water,
            - 1 represents land.
            - Each cell is a square with side length 1.
            - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically, not diagonally.
            - The grid is completely surrounded by water, has only one island (or none),
              and the island does not contain "lakes" (water completely surrounded by land).

    Returns:
        int: The perimeter of the island.
